Tailwind CSS â€” Learning Progression

A clean, structured repo capturing my handsâ€‘on journey with Tailwind CSS through small-but-polished projects. Each app focuses on a specific UI/UX skill: utility-first styling, component composition, responsive layouts, and tasteful motion.


ðŸš€ Projects

1) Medium Digest Clone

Goal: Fetch and display stories from Medium Digest via RSS/XML and present them in a sleek, responsive feed.

Highlights

RSS/XML fetching (using rss-parser) and transformation into typed post objects.

Card-based layout with responsive grid, line-clamp for excerpts, and accessible focus states.

Mobile-first; scales up with CSS grid and container queries / responsive utilities.
